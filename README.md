🛡️ Secure Bidirectional Messaging System
A Python-based encrypted chat framework implementing Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authentication using RSA and AES.
📘 Overview
This project demonstrates the design of a secure communication system that ensures:
🔒 Confidentiality – using AES-256 encryption
🧾 Integrity – using RSA digital signatures
🔐 Authentication – via asymmetric key exchange
The system allows bidirectional, encrypted communication between a client and a multi-threaded server.
⚙️ Features
RSA-based public-key exchange and AES session key encryption
Digital signatures for integrity verification
AES-GCM symmetric encryption for confidentiality
Multithreaded socket server (supports multiple clients)
Classical ciphers (Caesar, Monoalphabetic, Transposition) added for comparative learning
🧩 Tech Stack
Python 3.10+, Socket Programming, RSA, AES, Cryptography Library, Multithreading
🚀 How to Run
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install cryptography sympy

# 2. Start the server
python -m network.server

# 3. Start the client
python -m network.client
